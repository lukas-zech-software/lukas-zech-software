# Hi, I'm Lukas Zech a Full Stack Developer passionate about **Teamwork** and **Clean Code**

Backend, frontend, testing, DevOps & architecture — "Full Stack" for me means a holistic approach to software solutions. Just like the technical components, the team also needs to communicate well — because software development is a team sport!

In my **14 years as a software developer**, including **10 years as a freelancer**, I’ve gained extensive experience across all areas of software development and team collaboration. I’m now looking to bring that experience into a **long-term permanent position**.


> "Clean code and strong communication aren't luxuries — they're the foundation of good software."
